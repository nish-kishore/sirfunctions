Description: The sirfunctions package contains key functions used by the
    Surveillance, Innovation, and Research (SIR) team within the Polio
    Eradication Branch (PEB) at the Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC). It includes functions to download cleaned global
    polio data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Polio Information
    System (POLIS) and geographic files. In addition, the package contains
    functions to visualize important epidemiological trends and perform
    key performance indicators such as NPAFP rates, EV rates, and stool
    adequacy. Apart from getting data and calculating key indicators,
    there are several functions that also facilitate communication,
    visualize trends, and perform data quality checks.
