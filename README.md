## Overview

The `sirfunctions` package contains key functions used by the Surveillance, Innovation, and Research (SIR) team within the Polio Eradication Branch (PEB) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It includes functions to download cleaned global polio data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Polio Information System (POLIS) and geographic files. In addition, the package contains functions to visualize important epidemiological trends and perform key performance indicators such as NPAFP rates, EV rates, and stool adequacy.

## Installation and Updates

Ensure that `devtools` is installed (if not run `install.packages("devtools")`). Then run the following command:

```         
devtools::install_github("nish-kishore/sirfunctions")
```

Remember to update `sirfunctions` regularly. If no update is needed, the line of code above will automatically skip.

## Usage

Use any function developed in this package using: `sirfunctions::{function}`

For example: `sirfunctions::edav_io(io = "list")`

You can find the documentation for any function by running: `?sirfunctions::{function}`

For example: `?sirfunctions::edav_io`

## Functions

Here is a current list of core functions included in `sirfunctions` with
brief descriptions.

**NOTE**: Any functions getting data or those that interact with EDAV require authenticated connection to CDC EDAV resources.

### Get Data

1)  `get_all_polio_data`: this is the primary function which loads all
    recent polio data. Parameters can be used to specify date ranges,
    data selection and user verification.
2)  `edav_io`: perform key writing/reading/editing functions for EDAV
    from your R system.
3)  `load_clean_{resolution}_sp`: 'resolution\` can be *dist*, *prov* or
    *ctry*. Parameters can be used to specify date or spatial ranges as
    well as the output.
4)  `init_dr`: this is the primary function to initialize the desk
    review analytic pipeline. This function handles folder organization
    and download of data for a specific country. Visualization functions
    in the desk review will be downloaded as well.

### Communications

1)  `send_teams_message`: send a message to a teams channel with
    attachments.
2)  `upload_to_sharepoint`: upload a document to a sharepoint folder.
3)  `send_outlook_email`: send an email from the validated microsoft
    account.

### Key calculations

1)  `extract_country_data`: expects a 'raw.data' object that is
    generated by `get_all_polio_data()` which includes spatial data.
    Generates a country specific data file along with relevant spatial
    objects.
2)  `f.ev.rate.01`: calculate the enterovirus detection rate using CDC
    cleaned environmental surveillance data.
3)  `f.npafp.rate.01`: calculate the non-polio (NP) acute flaccid
    paralysis (AFP) rate accounting for person-time at risk using CDC
    cleaned AFP data and appropriately matched population data.
4)  `f.stool.ad.01`: calculate stool adequacy using CDC cleaned acute
    flaccid paralysis (AFP) data.
5)  `f.timely.detection.01`: calculate the timeliness of detection of
    cases using CDC cleaned acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) data.
6)  `f.timely.01`: calculate the timeliness of stool data using only epi
    data.  

### Visualization
1)  `create_emergence_group_gif`: function to visualize the spread of
    specific emegrence groups.
2) `generate_adhoc_map`: function to visualize outbreaks.

### Helper functions

1)  `test_EDAV_connection`: Evaluates the speed of connection that users
    have with the CDC EDAV system.
2)  `f.color.schemes`: Adds Standard color schemes used in figure
    creation by the SIR team.
3)  `f.expand.bbox`: Expands a geographic bounding box generated for
    maps.
4)  `f.metadata.tag`: Adds a tag using information from the CDC
    generated 'raw.data' file to ggplot and flextable objects.
5)  `f.plot.looks`: Adds standard themes used in figure creation by the
    SIR team.
6) `duplicate_check`: checks for duplicates in the output of `get_all_polio_data()`.
7) `check_afp_guid_ctry_data`: checks for GUIDS present in the AFP dataset but not in the population files.
8) `fix_ctry_data_missing_guids`: fixes unknown GUIDS in the AFP linelist by
   obtaining GUIDs found in the pop files based on province and district names for specific years.
10) `compress_png`: compress PNG files. _Note: requires installation of the pngquant software._
11) `get_diff_cols`: get the columns where records differ in a group. Useful for identifying where duplicates differ.
