# SIR Functions

## Description

Key functions used by the SIR team

## Installation and Updates

First make sure you have `devtools` installed (if not run
`install.pacakges("devtools")`). Then run the following command:

```         
devtools::install_github("nish-kishore/sirfunctions")
```

Remember to update from `sirfunctions` regularly. If no update is needed
the line of code above will automatically skip.

## Usage

After, you can use any function developed in this package using

```         
sirfunctions::{function}
```

for example:

```         
sirfunctions::edav_io(io = "list")
```

You can find the documentation for any function by running

```         
?sirfunctions::{function}
```

for example:

```         
?sirfunctions::edav_io
```

## Functions

Here is a current list of core functions included in `sirfunctions` with
brief descriptions.

*NOTE: Any "Get Data" functions or those that interact with EDAV require
authenticated connection to CDC EDAV resources*

### Get Data

1)  `get_all_polio_data`: This is the primary function which loads all
    recent polio data. Parameters can be used to specify date ranges,
    data selection and user verification.
2)  `edav_io`: Perform key writing/reading/editing functions for EDAV
    from your R system.
3)  `load_clean_{resolution}_sp`: 'resolution\` can be *dist*, *prov* or
    *ctry*. Parameters can be used to specify date or spatial ranges as
    well as the output.
4)  `init_dr`: This is the primary function to initialize the desk
    review analytic pipeline. This function handles folder organization
    and download of data for a specific country.

### Communications

1)  `send_teams_message`: Send a message to a teams channel with
    attachments.
2)  `upload_to_sharepoint`: Upload a document to a sharepoint folder.
3)  `send_outlook_email`: Send an email from the validated microsoft
    account.

### Key calculations

1)  `extract_country_data`: Expects a 'raw.data' object that is
    generated by `get_all_polio_data()` which includes spatial data.
    Generates a country specific data file along with relevant spatial
    objects.
2)  `f.ev.rate.01`: Calculate the enterovirus detection rate using CDC
    cleaned environmental surveillance data.
3)  `f.npafp.rate.01`: Calculate the non-polio (NP) acute flaccid
    paralysis (AFP) rate accounting for person-time at risk using CDC
    cleaned AFP data and appropriately matched population data.
4)  `f.stool.ad.01`: Calculate stool adequacy using CDC cleaned acute
    flaccid paralysis (AFP) data.
5)  `f.timely.detection.01`: Calculate the timeliness of detection of
    cases using CDC cleaned acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) data.
6)  `f.timely.01`: Calculate the timeliness of stool data using only epi
    data.

### Helper functions

1)  `test_EDAV_connection`: Evaluates the speed of connection that users
    have with the CDC EDAV system.
2)  `f.color.schemes`: Adds Standard color schemes used in figure
    creation by the SIR team.
3)  `f.expand.bbox`: Expands a geographic bounding box generated for
    maps.
4)  `f.metadata.tag`: Adds a tag using information from the CDC
    generated 'raw.data' file to ggplot and flextable objects.
5)  `f.plot.looks`: Adds standard themes used in figure creation by the
    SIR team.
6)  `create_emergence_group_gif()`: function to visualize the spread of
    specific emegrence groups.
